# Privacy Tools Guide: Website for Encrypted Software & Apps

###### Sadly, our old and popular GitHub repository was hijacked for malicious reasons together with our subreddit by the PrivacyGuides team. The full background story to summarize the incidents and behavior: https://www.privacytools.io/guides/jonah-aragon-privacyguides-failed-attempt-to-takeover

This new GitHub page for PrivacyTools.io will serve now as a community hub where we keep an up-to-date list of all social media profiles we're maintaining to keep in touch with our community.

# Why is PrivacyTools.io on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, etc.?

For the simple reason that our target audience, privacy unaware people, are using them and therefore a good way to raise awareness for privacy tools and promote open-source software alternatives and reach a large audience. It wouldn't make sense to choose Mastodon as our sole outlet because Mastodon users are general speaking already privacy-aware.
