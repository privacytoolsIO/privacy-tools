# Privacy Tools Guide: Encrypted Software & Apps - Open-Source

Sadly, our old and popular GitHub repository was hijacked for malicious reasons together with our subreddit by the PrivacyGuides team. The full background story to summarize the incidents and behavior: https://www.privacytools.io/guides/jonah-aragon-privacyguides-failed-attempt-to-takeover

This new GitHub page for PrivacyTools.io will serve now as a community hub where we keep an up-to-date list of all social media profiles we're maintaining to keep in touch with our community.

# Why is PrivacyTools.io on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, etc.?

For the simple reason that our target audience, privacy unaware people, are using them and therefore a good way to raise awareness for privacy tools and promote open-source software alternatives and reach a large audience. It wouldn't make sense to choose Mastodon as our sole outlet because Mastodon users are general speaking already privacy-aware.
